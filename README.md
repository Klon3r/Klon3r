# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome, my name is Keiran Bunyan ðŸ‘‹

*"One day challenged myself to learn web development since I didn't know anything about it, fast forward ...well turns out that I fell in love with it."*


I just recently graduated from a **Computer Science Degree**, I specialise in web development and I am seeking an entry-level/graduate position.

- I love all things programming & linux.
- I love problem solving and thinking about ways to solve problems.
- I love spending my free time working on my projects.

I have a strong desire to gain practical experience within the tech industry & work on projects with others.
